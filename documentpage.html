    <h1 style="margin-left: 300px;">What is C++?</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;" >C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, 
       it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;">C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;"> How to print Hello World in C++? :</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;background-color: rgb(242, 237, 237);font-size: 20px;"> cout << "Hello world!";</p>
    <P style="margin-left: 300px;">The main pillars of Object oriented programming are:</P>
    <ul style="margin-left: 350px;">
        <li>Object and Classes</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
        <li>Abstraction</li>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style="margin-left: 300px;">Object and Classes</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;">Class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it is not the object itself. Also, what we call, a class is the building block that leads to Object-Oriented Programming. It is a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the blueprint of any object. Once we have written a class and defined it, we can use it to create as many objects based on that class as we want.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;">Object is an instance of a class. All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but memory is allocated when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created). For Example, considering the objects for the class Account are SBI Account, ICICI account, etc.</p>
    <h1 style="margin-left: 300px;">Inheritance</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 300px;" >The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
